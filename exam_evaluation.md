Exam feed back (overall courses)
One of the hardest things to learn in programming is not the syntax you need to learn, but how to apply it to solve real world problems. You need to start thinking like a programmer — this generally involves looking at descriptions of what your program needs to do, working out what code features are needed to achieve those things, and how to make them work together.
This requires a mixture of hard work, experience with the programming syntax, and practice — plus a bit of creativity. The more you code, the better you'll get at it. We can't promise that you'll develop "programmer brain" in five minutes, but we will give you plenty of opportunity to practice thinking like a programmer throughout the course.
After the Q2 midterms, this has taught me 3 things:
-	My linear thinking speed is no longer an issue. The issue now is I can’t think broadly(flexively) enough.
-	Every course exams have different methods to tackling it
-	I REALLY need to do the properly previews instead of half-assing them.
Details:
-	Your next challenge is tackling the closed-minded thinking. You tend to memorize exercises and concepts. While sometimes this is necessary, a lot of the times this is NOT ENOUGH. Exams are ALWAYS taking what we learned and adding a twist, thus you need to be able to think flexibly. 
-	You got to be more flexible with your thinking. Not necessarily think outside the box but really understand(not just know) the concept and exercise BEFORE the exams and able to make variations to them.
-	Take ADS; when you say you fail to understand the overarching goal of the problem, it is likely that when you see a familiar problem, you start implementing almost identical code to the implementation exercises without considering the fact that it has been altered, so your solution should be altered as well, which means you have to THINK in a different way. 
Example#1:
When you were doing the ADS midterm assignment one: singly linked list stack, you were so fixated on the textbook picture of the singly linked list, that you didn’t think about the fact that the picture can be altered depending on the situation. You didn’t realize that the nodes don’t always have to be added at the end, or that the header don’t always have to point to the first node; the header get point to the ‘top’ of the stack

Example#2:
During the Calculus midterm assignment one: you recognized the problem as a similar one you saw on grasple. When you differentiated, the formula is G(3x^3), you forgot to also differentiate the 3x^3, which would result in g(3x^x)*9x^2. This wasn’t present during the practice grasple exercise, so you forgot to do the crucial differentiation of the inner function as well. This shows carelessness, but most importantly that you relied on a memorized solution technique too much that you failed to consider the other details. In short, you weren’t thinking flexibly. 

-	Solving previously solved problems is okay but IT IS NOT ENOUGH! You will never get the same problem in an exam. The real practice is when you are faced with a new problem and you follow the correct and right steps to solving it. This requires thinking a concept differently and changing your implementations away from the memorized. This kind of flexible thinking and problem solving skill is what they are training you to do in TU Delft. So don't memorize, really think. 
-	In addition, when you get stuck in ADS and Calculus, you tend to look for the answers, instead of taking a moment and thinking about what the core problem is and retackling it.  Stop seeking merely for answers. Not only is this sign of weakness, it will also lead to not proper learning and eventual failure. 
-	When you immediately look at answers, or give up the question before finishing it, you are not training yourself to thinking broadly. You try out the method that worked before but if it doesn't work now, you tend to give up. THIS IS NOT THE  CORRECT WAY TO DO IT!! In fact, this will lead to failure and a huge waste of time, effort, and resources.
-	You have to really train your mind to think broadly and reflexively by keep searching for the solution and holding on to the frustration. This is also part of the plasticity training. The other guys who get crazy good grades have been doing it since young age. You have to catch up to them.
-	When solving mock exams really put yourself in a position like it is an actual exam. More details:

Methods:
-	When you hit the point of frustration because you are stuck on a problem, DON’T ESCAPE IT. In fact, embrace it, like how Andrew Huberman said. That is when the real neuro plasticity is triggered. 

At least spend 1 hour for ADS implementation questions and 15 mins for Calculus or written ADS question. This doesn’t mean think slowly; this is simply giving you time to approach it in different ways

-	Get a good impression of the course:
1.	When starting a new course at new quarter, look at mock exams, past exams to see what the exam will look like. Get a good impression of it. 
2.	By the end of weak 1, get a good idea of HOW to study; figure out what you need to do to solve questions and what NOT to do
Example) ADS will always use weblab so I can check whether my implementations work. But for Calculus, I don’t have a chance to check if my calculations are correct, so I have to be extra careful with calculus exams.

-	Don’t put too much focus on solving previously solved problems just so you can feel good. The real focus is solving NEW PROBLEMS but also in a CORRECT MANNER and SITUATION 

-	Solving new exercises and mock exams:
1.	1 week before the exams, really solve mock exams like an actual setting. This is where you really have to fight the urge to look immediately at the answers.
2.	Focus on solving NEW mock exams and not previously solved ones
3.	REALLY TIME YOURSELF. This time, give yourself the same amount of time you would get in an exam. But if you really go over the time limit this time, you are fucked. 
4.	Approach the questions like an actual exam setting: double check, write calculations neatly and scrap for others. Consistently ask yourself:
o	‘Am I missing anything?’ 
o	‘Am I getting the big picture?’
o	‘In the detail, is there part of my code that doesn’t make sense logically or mathematically?’
o	‘In my calculation, did I carelessly gloss-over anything?’
5.	When you are stuck, it is time to stop thinking linearly and think horizontal. To do that, don't look at the question, calculation or code; it will only be a waste of time. Several methods:
a.	Get an empty sheet of paper and start doodling. Draw mindlessly while thinking. Ignore the ticking time for a short moment
b.	Close your eyes and/or doze off
Notice how the ideas to the solutions often comes up when you are NOT focused at the question? 

-	PROPERLY PREPARE FOR PREVIEWS! DON’T SLACK OFF!!!

-	For calculus:
o	Treat every problem like a problem and look at it objectively
o	Have two separate papers; one for writing out the calculations (do it neatly and eligibly like you are taking notes) and the other for scrap (quick calculations, ideas, etc). This way when you are double checking, you are not bothered by the illegible scrap writing
o	Have the bigger picture in mind. Don’t get too caught up in the details. When finished look at it from whole. Does it make sense?

-	To help you think flexively and not so close-minded, try new things. New music, new films, new tv shows, etc. Just try new things to escape the way of closed thinking

exam feedback (you reap what you sow)

- SQT ENSURE ALL COMPILES, otherwise no rade
- Practice with no analyse test or hints functionality. Try to get ALL 
points without any assistance. Time yourself to 45 minutes
- For assignemnt intesenive courses, ask if the exam will be the same or if some 
functions will be removed (including difficulty)
-	Often times you lose points not because you don’t know the answer but because of mistakes that can occur in stressful test situations. Therefore REALLY DO THIS MOCK!! DON’T BE LAZY
Remember SQT almost cost you big
