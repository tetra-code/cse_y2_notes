## Definition of vector space
Given a field F and a set V with:
- v + w for all v, w ∈ V
- scalar multiplication s*v for all s ∈ F, v ∈ V

which satisfy all the following axioms for ALL u, v, w ∈ V and ALL r, s ∈ F:
- *associativity*: u + (v + w) = (u + v) + w
- *commutativity*: v + w = w + v
- *neutral element*: There is a 0 ∈ V such that 0 + v = v
- *inverse element*: There is a −v ∈ V such that v − v = 0
- *associativity for scalars*: r(sv) = (rs)v
- *neutral element for scalars*: 1v = v
- distributivity I: r(v + w) = rv + rw
- distributivity II: (r + s)v = rv + sv
